To resolve this issue, ensure the `div p` selector has a higher specificity. The simplest solution is to either use the `!important` flag or to make the selector more specific (though `!important` should be used sparingly). 

Here's the corrected CSS:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green !important; /* Using !important (use cautiously) */
}
```

Alternatively, a more specific selector could be used (though it may not always be practical or desirable):

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div > p { /*Using a child combinator to make the selector more specific */
  color: green;
}
```
This illustrates the potential pitfalls of relying solely on apparent selector nesting for specificity and underscores the importance of comprehending CSS specificity rules.
