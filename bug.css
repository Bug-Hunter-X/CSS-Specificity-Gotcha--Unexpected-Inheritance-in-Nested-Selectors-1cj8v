The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This rule is less specific than expected */
}
```

The unexpected behavior lies in the fact that the `div p` selector, while seemingly more specific than just `p`, may not always override the `p` selector's style due to CSS specificity rules.  Depending on the location of the stylesheets or the order of declarations, the `color: red` may still apply. This happens because although `div p` targets a more specific element combination, the overall specificity calculation can still favor the `p` selector, specifically if there are other rules impacting the `p` element.

This can be easily overlooked if one assumes that nested selectors automatically have higher specificity.
